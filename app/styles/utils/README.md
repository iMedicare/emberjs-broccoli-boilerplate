## Usage

Utilities are low-level. They have a very narrow scope and may end up being
used frequently, due to their separation from the semantics of the document and
the theming of a component. As a result, once a class is in significant use
great care should be taken when introducing any modifications to it.

Utilities make use of `!important` to ensure that their styles always apply
ahead of those defined in a component's dedicated CSS.

### Templating

Each utility class modifies a single trait (a small collection of similar
styles).

To apply a trait, or a combination of traits to an element, add the
corresponding class directly to the HTML.

Together, they can form a wide variety of UI patterns from simple principles.
Although you won't _always_ want to use combinations of utilities to generate
more complicated patterns, the option is there. Refactoring a component's HTML
to move particular utility traits into the component's own styles is a
relatively simple task.

The following contrived example would be a structural template for a simple
Tweet-like component. You would then create a new CSS file for the component to
contain any additional, specific styles (often a "skin" or "theme") needed to
fully realise the component.

```html
<article class="Tweet">
  <a class="u-floatRight" href="{{permalinkUrl}}">
    {{time}}
  </a>
  <a class="u-floatLeft" href="{{userUrl}}">
    <img src="{{userAvatar}}" alt="{{username}}'s avatar">
  </a>
  <div class="u-sizeFill">
    <a class="u-linkComplex" href="{{userUrl}}">
      <span class="u-linkComplexTarget">{{fullname}}</span>
      <span>@{{username}}</span>
    </a>

    <p class="u-textBreak">{{text}}</p>

    <div>
      <a class="u-linkComplex" href="#" role="button">
        <span class="Icon Icon--reply"></span>
        <span class="u-linkComplexTarget">Reply</span>
      </a>
      <a href="#" role="button">
        <span class="Icon Icon--favorite"></span>
        <span class="u-hiddenVisually">Favorite</span>
      </a>
      ...
    </div>
  </div>
</article>
```
