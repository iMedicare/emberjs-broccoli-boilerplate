# SUIT CSS

Style tools for component-based UI development.

SUIT CSS provides a reliable and testable styling solution for component-based
web application development. The project includes:

* [CSS base styles](https://github.com/suitcss/base) for web apps.
* [CSS utilities](https://github.com/suitcss/utils).
* [CSS components](https://github.com/suitcss/components).
* A [future-facing CSS preprocessor](https://github.com/suitcss/preprocessor)

Each of these modules are made up of smaller modules, making it easy to customize
your setup and build pipeline.

**[Documentation](doc/README.md)**.

## Example

SUIT CSS makes use of variables, custom media queries, and dependency resolution for CSS.

HTML:

```html
<article class="Excerpt u-cf">
  <img class="Excerpt-thumbnail u-sizeFit" src="{{src}}" alt="">
  <div class="u-sizeFill">
    <h1 class="Excerpt-title"><a href="{{url}}">{{title}}</a></h1>
    <p class="Excerpt-text u-textBreak">{{description}}</p>
    <span class="Excerpt-readMore">
      <!-- BUTTON COMPONENT -->
    </span>
  </div>
</article>
```

CSS:

```css
/** @define Excerpt; use strict */

@import "utils-layout";
@import "utils-size";
@import "utils-text";
@import "./Button";

/**
 * Content excerpts. Agnostic of image size, and with a clear call to action.
 */

:root {
  --Excerpt-padding: 20px;
  --Excerpt-highlight-color: orange;
}

.Excerpt {
  padding: var(--Excerpt-padding);
}

.Excerpt-thumbnail {
  border: 2px solid var(--Excerpt-highlight-color);
  border-radius: 3px;
  margin-right: 10px;
}

.Excerpt-title {
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;
  margin: 0 0 15px;
  padding-bottom: 5px;
}

.Excerpt-readMore {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 10px;
}
```

## CSS packages

Each CSS package can be installed with npm, Component(1), or Bower.
It's suggested that you depend on individual packages as and when you need
them, however, you can install all the CSS packages at once if you prefer:

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/): `npm install suitcss`
* [Component(1)](https://github.com/component/component): `component install suitcss/suit`
* [Bower](http://bower.io/): `bower install suit`

Each package is stand-alone, contains its own documentation and tests, and is
written to follow a common set of [naming conventions](doc/naming-conventions.md).

* [base](https://github.com/suitcss/base/): a thin reset for web apps, built on top of normalize.css.
* [utils](https://github.com/suitcss/utils/): all the utility packages.
* [components-arrange](https://github.com/suitcss/components-arrange/): flexbox-like horizontal arrangements.
* [components-button](https://github.com/suitcss/components-button/): robust, structural button styles.
* [components-flex-embed](https://github.com/suitcss/components-flex-embed/): aspect-ratios for embeds.
* [components-grid](https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid/): a grid foundation.
* [components-test](https://github.com/suitcss/components-test/): structure for visual tests.
* [theme](https://github.com/suitcss/theme/): example theme.

You can also download pre-built bundles to try things out without setting up a
build process:

* [base bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/base/releases)
* [utils bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/utils/releases)
* [components bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/components/releases)
* [everything bundle](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/releases) (only 4.4KB minified and gzipped)

## Build and test tools

The [suitcss-preprocessor](https://github.com/suitcss/preprocessor) runs CSS
through a build pipeline. It performs per-file tests for conformance to the
SUIT CSS naming conventions, and per-bundle tests for the IE selector limit.
CSS build and test tools.

The preprocessor makes use of:

* [autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer): automatic vendor prefixing
* [rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework): a plugin framework for CSS preprocessing
* [rework-suit](https://github.com/suitcss/rework-suit): a collection of "pure CSS" plugins for Rework
* [rework-suit-conformance](https://github.com/suitcss/rework-suit-conformance): a SUIT CSS conformance tool

* [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js)
* [Ember.js Components](http://emberjs.com/guides/components/)
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)

Tools and dependency managers:

* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/): package manager.
* [Component(1)](https://github.com/component/component): front-end package manager and build tool.
